## Hi there üëã

Welcome to the NUCAPS github page! Here we have code examples for working with NUCAPS and related datasets. NUCAPS data can be order from [NOAA CLASS](https://www.class.noaa.gov/) or access via the NOAA NODD Program via [the Registry of Open Data on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-jpss/). All NUCAPS data users are welcome to contribute code examples.

## What are Satellite Soundings?
Satellite soundings measure vertical profiles of the atmosphere, so that scientists and weather forecasters can see the temperature, humidity, and trace gas concentrations at different pressure levels/heights. Soundings are different from other visible and infrared satellite imagery, which cannot ‚Äúsee‚Äù through clouds and can only make one image. Research applications include short-term severe weather prediction, studying fire weather, and monitoring the long range transport of smoke.

[NUCAPS](https://weather.ndc.nasa.gov/nucaps/) is an algorithms that converts the raw satellite signal to meaningful data. NUCAPS is primarily used for real-time processing of satellite soundings; the data are released to the public up to 30 mins after an overpass through direct broadcast.

To learn more about NUCAPS, view some of the available [quick guides](https://weather.ndc.nasa.gov/nucaps/resources_training.html), [peer-reviewed papers](https://weather.ndc.nasa.gov/nucaps/resources_publications.html), or read the [ATBD](https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/jpss/documents/ATBD/ATBD_NUCAPS_v3.1.pdf) for the most detailed explanation.
